Read the AI behavior tree guidelines before starting your development task.

Execute these steps:
1. Read `.trellis/spec/ai/index.md` to understand available guidelines
2. Based on your task, read the relevant guideline files:
   - Beehave basics → `.trellis/spec/ai/beehave-guidelines.md`
   - Monster AI → `.trellis/spec/ai/monster-ai-patterns.md`
   - Player behavior → `.trellis/spec/ai/player-behavior-patterns.md`
   - Pet AI → `.trellis/spec/ai/pet-ai-patterns.md`
   - Node reference → `.trellis/spec/ai/condition-action-reference.md`
3. Understand the behavior tree patterns and conventions
4. Then proceed with your development plan

This step is **mandatory** before creating or modifying behavior trees.
