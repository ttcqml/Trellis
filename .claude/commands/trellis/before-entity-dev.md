Read the entity development guidelines before starting your development task.

Execute these steps:
1. Read `.trellis/spec/entity/index.md` to understand available guidelines
2. Based on your task, read the relevant guideline files:
   - Entity structure → `.trellis/spec/entity/directory-structure.md`
   - Role class usage → `.trellis/spec/entity/role-guidelines.md`
   - Component setup → `.trellis/spec/entity/component-guidelines.md`
   - Behavior configuration → `.trellis/spec/entity/behavior-guidelines.md`
   - FlowKit patterns → `.trellis/spec/entity/flowkit-entity-patterns.md`
   - Collision setup → `.trellis/spec/entity/collision-guidelines.md`
3. Understand the coding standards and patterns you need to follow
4. Then proceed with your development plan

This step is **mandatory** before writing any entity code.
