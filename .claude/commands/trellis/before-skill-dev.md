Read the skill system guidelines before starting your development task.

Execute these steps:
1. Read `.trellis/spec/skill/index.md` to understand available guidelines
2. Based on your task, read the relevant guideline files:
   - SkillData resources → `.trellis/spec/skill/skill-data-guidelines.md`
   - Attack skills → `.trellis/spec/skill/attack-skill-patterns.md`
   - Buff/passive skills → `.trellis/spec/skill/buff-skill-patterns.md`
   - Bullet motion → `.trellis/spec/skill/bullet-motion-patterns.md`
   - Skill events → `.trellis/spec/skill/skill-event-guidelines.md`
3. Understand the skill system architecture and patterns
4. Then proceed with your development plan

This step is **mandatory** before creating or modifying skills.
