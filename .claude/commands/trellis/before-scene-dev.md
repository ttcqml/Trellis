Read the scene development guidelines before starting your development task.

Execute these steps:
1. Read `.trellis/spec/scene/index.md` to understand available guidelines
2. Based on your task, read the relevant guideline files:
   - Scene structure → `.trellis/spec/scene/directory-structure.md`
   - Level design → `.trellis/spec/scene/level-guidelines.md`
   - UI design → `.trellis/spec/scene/ui-guidelines.md`
   - Entity composition → `.trellis/spec/scene/entity-composition.md`
   - FlowKit patterns → `.trellis/spec/scene/flowkit-scene-patterns.md`
3. Understand the coding standards and patterns you need to follow
4. Then proceed with your development plan

This step is **mandatory** before creating or modifying scenes.
