## Core Principle

**Scene = Entity Assembly + System Logic**

Scenes don't create entities from scratch - they instantiate existing entity scenes and configure them through FlowKit System events.

## How to Fill These Guidelines

For each guideline file:

1. Document your project's **actual conventions**
2. Include **scene structure examples**
3. List **forbidden patterns** and why
4. Add **common mistakes** your team has made
