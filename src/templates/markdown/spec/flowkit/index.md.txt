## Overview

FlowKit is an event-driven visual scripting system for Godot. It enables game logic through declarative Event-Condition-Action patterns without writing code.

## FlowKit Architecture

```
Scene (.tscn)
├── System Node              # Global system events
├── Entity Nodes             # Entity-specific events
│   └── flowkit_behaviors    # Behavior meta
└── Event Sheet (.tres)      # Auto-saved to addons/flowkit/saved/
```

---

## Core Concepts

### Event Blocks

Each event block contains:
- **Event**: Trigger condition (when)
- **Conditions**: Filter conditions (if)
- **Actions**: What to do (then)

### Node Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| System | Global game events |
| Entity | Game object events |

## How to Fill These Guidelines

For each guideline file:

1. Document your project's **FlowKit patterns**
2. Include **event configuration examples**
3. List **common event/condition/action combos**
4. Add **FlowKit debugging tips**
