# Thinking Guides

> **Purpose**: Expand your thinking to catch things you might not have considered.

## Why Thinking Guides?

**Most bugs and tech debt come from "didn't think of that"**, not from lack of skill:

- Didn't think about system interactions → Entity-FlowKit-AI integration bugs
- Didn't think about component composition → duplicated behaviors everywhere
- Didn't think about event flow → FlowKit events not triggering
- Didn't think about future maintainers → unreadable scenes

These guides help you **ask the right questions before coding**.

## Quick Reference: Thinking Triggers

### When to Think About Cross-System Issues

- [ ] Feature touches 3+ systems (Entity, Scene, Skill, AI)
- [ ] Data flows between FlowKit events and Beehave trees
- [ ] Multiple entities need the same behavior
- [ ] You're not sure where to put some logic

→ Read [Cross-System Thinking Guide](./cross-system-thinking-guide.md)

### When to Think About Code Reuse

- [ ] You're writing similar code to something that exists
- [ ] You see the same pattern repeated 3+ times
- [ ] You're adding a new field to multiple entities
- [ ] **You're modifying any constant or resource**
- [ ] **You're creating a new utility function** ← Search first!

→ Read [Code Reuse Thinking Guide](./code-reuse-thinking-guide.md)

## Pre-Modification Rule (CRITICAL)

> **Before changing ANY value, ALWAYS search first!**

```gdscript
# Search for the value you're about to change
grep -r "MAX_HEALTH" .
grep -r "health" *.tscn
```

This single habit prevents most "forgot to update X" bugs.

## How to Use This Directory

1. **Before coding**: Skim the relevant thinking guide
2. **During coding**: If something feels repetitive or complex, check the guides
3. **After bugs**: Add new insights to the relevant guide (learn from mistakes)
