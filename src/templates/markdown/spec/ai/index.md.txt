# AI Behavior Tree Guidelines

> Best practices for AI development using Beehave behavior trees.

---

## Overview

This directory contains guidelines for developing AI behavior using the Beehave behavior tree system. Behavior trees define entity decision-making for players, enemies, pets, and NPCs.

## Behavior Tree Architecture

```
BeehaveTree (root)
└── SelectorReactiveComposite
    ├── Sequence: die (death handling)
    ├── Sequence: attack (combat)
    └── Sequence: move (movement)
```

## Core Concepts

### Node Return Values

| Value | Meaning | Selector Behavior | Sequence Behavior |
|-------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| SUCCESS | Completed | Stop, return SUCCESS | Continue next |
| FAILURE | Failed | Try next child | Stop, return FAILURE |
| RUNNING | In progress | Stop, return RUNNING | Stop, return RUNNING |

## How to Fill These Guidelines

For each guideline file:

1. Document your project's **AI patterns**
2. Include **behavior tree examples**
3. List **condition/action patterns**
4. Add **common AI bugs** your team has encountered
